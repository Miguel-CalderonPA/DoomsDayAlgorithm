# DoomsDayAlgorithm
* Android App: Finds the day corresponding to a date using a variation of Conway's Doomsday Algorithm
* *NOTE: Based on Gregorian Calender, which was implemented in 1582. Historial documentation before this date will not align because those were on the Julian Calender. 

# What I Learned
* Increased experience with Java and it's built-in classes like Calender, first android app using Java rather than Kotlin
* Problem Solving techniques specficially handling days between centuryCode & Doomsday
* Setting up the screen to match every Android device by setting most buttons/textviews to parent
* Dropdown menus (spinners) in Android, adapters, onCheckListener, & optimization
